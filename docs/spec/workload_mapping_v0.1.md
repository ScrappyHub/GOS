# Workload Mapping v0.1 (Who Owns What)

## Host (GOS)
- enforcement
- policy gate
- sandbox
- package verification
- audit/seal
- restore substrate

## CORE
- deterministic measurement runs
- sealed run artifacts

## Covenant Gate
- allow/deny reasoning layer
- overlay policy support (more walls only)

## Rooted
- curated discovery + institution UX
- runs as governed app, not governance authority

## Atlas / Atlas Artifact
- update scheduling + execution requests
- lifecycle orchestration (still governed)

## Legacy Doctor
- hardware verifier/repair
- device health reports
- can request restore actions (policy gate decides)

## Clarity
- pre-OS validator (firmware trust anchor)
- may also exist as a workload for diagnostics/media

## Rebound
- verified communication layer
- sender-to-receiver proof artifacts
